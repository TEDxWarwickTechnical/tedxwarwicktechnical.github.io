How can the design of a desk or lampshade change the way we work? Can we design
a language that can be understood by every human on the planet? Should our
democracies be redesigned to return back to their true purpose?

Our first Salon of the year, themed *By Design*, focuses on how the structural
reconfiguration of big ideas can create an impact on our lives on every scale.
It aims to provide a platform for a special calibre of global movers and
shakers, those who are deconstructing big issues and the intricacies of the
world's grand blueprint - until their proactivity creates remarkable change.
*By Design* is an exploration of inspiration, purpose, and ingenuity.
