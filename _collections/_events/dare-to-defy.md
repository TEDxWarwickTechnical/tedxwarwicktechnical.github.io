### Defiance. Refusing to obey. Striding into the unknown.

In today's society, we face a plethora of expectations, stereotypes, and
standards which impede the development of our individuality. But what if we
rejected these externally imposed conditions? What if we defied societal
standards? What if we chose to live free of expectations?

Celebrating its 10th anniversary, TEDxWarwick honours those who have
revolutionised our society and continue to do so. Those who have redefined
'the possible'. Those who have taken risks and acted against the norm. Our aim
is simple: to spread the ideas of these daring individuals and to inspire you
to go beyond the ordinary. This year, we choose to outclass the orthodox,
surpass the standard, and challenge the conventional. Will you join us? We dare
you.
