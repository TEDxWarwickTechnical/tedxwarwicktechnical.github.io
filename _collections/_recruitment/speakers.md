## Open Speaker Applications

Continuing from TEDxWarwick 2018, we are looking for speakers and performers
for our upcoming 2018 conference. Applications will be accepted from all
backgrounds, from all over the UK. For more information, see
[TED's FAQ](http://conferences.ted.com/TED2013/auditions/faq.php).

We will also be holding smaller TEDxWarwick events known as salons throughout
the year.

*Please note: Anyone under the age of 18 will need the consent of a legal
guardian. Evidence of this should be submitted to
[content@tedxwarwick.com](mailto:content@tedxwarwick.com).*

#### Who are we looking for?

This year, we're looking to hear from speakers and performers who have captured
the need for people to look at things from a different perspective. We are
particularly interested in individuals who have taken an approach to reinvent
their discipline and portray a comprehensive knowledge of a topic through their
design or through an experience. Performers are given more flexibility in this
regard, with more emphasis being placed on innovation.

#### How do you become a TEDxWarwick Speaker or Performer?

TEDxWarwick accepts Speaker & Performer Applications for its upcoming events
year round. Any member of the public is welcome to apply as a speaker or
performer. Applicants do not have to be residents of Warwick. We accept
applications from everywhere within the UK.

#### How does it work?

Just complete the submission form below and our team will respond as soon as
possible. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, and applying early
may be beneficial. You have the option of attaching a video file with a maximum
length of two minutes. The submission will be reviewed by our Content Team, who
will reply by email. Please aim to be concise, limiting your answers to
approximately 150 words per question. Please note that we review applications on 
a rolling basis for all of our events during the academic year. Unfortunately, 
due to the very large volume of applications we receive, we are only able to 
reply to successful candidates. Thank you for your interest - and good luck!
