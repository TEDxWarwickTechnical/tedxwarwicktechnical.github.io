##### The foundation stones of the future are being laid.

Tomorrow's scientific breakthroughs, politics, business, culture and society
are being built today, by forward thinking individuals the world over.

For the 11th year running, TEDxWarwick casts its eyes forward to the future
that we are in the midst of creating - for better or worse. In a day filled
with talks, performances, breakout sessions and more, we aim to find and
celebrate the ideas of 14 fantastic people who are changing today's landscape
to carve out our shared future - the <span class="red">***Architects of
Tomorrow***</span>.

Join us as we'll be revealing the speakers of the largest student-run TEDx
conference in Europe over the coming weeks. Past speakers include: writer and
political activist, Noam Chomsky; Planet Earth 2 producer, Ed Charles;
Cameroon's first female presidential candidate, Kah Walla, and many more.

From successful entrepreneurship and the latest developments in medicine, clean
energy and artificial intelligence, to stories of personal struggle and
achievement, our 2019 edition aims to go above and beyond to showcase the ideas
that are beginning to shape the course of our next steps.
