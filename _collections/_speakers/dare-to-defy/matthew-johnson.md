Matthew Johnson is Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry at the University of Copenhagen and co-founder of and Chief Science Officer at Airlabs, a company made up of a team of atmospheric chemists and airflow engineers devoted to reducing people's exposure to air pollution; they do this by designing flexible, low powered, low maintenance air cleaning installations.

Johnson, whose role means that he leads the effort to invent research based solutions to harmful city air, will elaborate on both the often overlooked problem of air pollution as well as Airlabs' inspiring, innovative and radical ventures, from their creation of an anti-pollution bus shelter to the Airbubbl, the first filter shown to successfully remove nitrogen dioxide and traffic pollution from inside cars.
