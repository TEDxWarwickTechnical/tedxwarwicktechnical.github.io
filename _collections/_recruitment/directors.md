### TEDxWarwick 2019 Director Recruitment

TEDxWarwick is one of the largest TEDx events in Europe. An annual event,
TEDxWarwick takes place in the well-renowned Warwick Arts Centre, attracting an
audience of 1200 people and garnering an online viewership of over 4 million.
TEDxWarwick consistently attracts a diverse range of the highest calibre
speakers from across the world to share their ideas worth spreading. Organising
an event of such prestige requires a diverse, talented and passionate team.

There are a few general qualities every TEDxWarwick director must have. These
include: exceptional leadership skills; a strong commitment to--and willingness
to dedicate significant amounts of time to--the organisation of the event;
excellent professionalism, and an understanding of TED and its ethos. We
encourage applications both from previous team members and those who haven't
been a part of the TEDxWarwick team before.

The TEDxWarwick team is organised into 8 sub-teams, each led by a director (and
in some cases a deputy or vice director as well). We are pleased to announce
that applications for our director positions are now open. All students,
undergraduate and postgraduate, are eligible to apply for a position. The
particular details of each team are described below:

<section id="team-operations">
#### Director of Operations
The Operations Team is responsible for the flawless execution of TEDxWarwick
2019\. This includes, but is not limited to: venue, catering, speaker travel
and volunteer management. The Operations team works closely with the other
TEDxWarwick teams to ensure that all logistics and operations are in order. The
Director must be able to communicate effectively with service providers,
coordinate a team quickly and efficiently and be able to deal with unexpected
problems. Due to the nature of the work, the Director of Operations must be
able to dedicate large amounts of time in the weeks leading up to the event.

##### Applicants must:
- Understand the various components that form event management
- Have strong organisational skills, with previous experience in organising
  events
- Have excellent attention to detail
- Have strong communication and problem solving skills
- Be flexible, passionate and willing to take the initiative
</section>

<section id="team-content">
#### Director of Content
The Content Team are tasked with the selection and curation of all speakers.
The Director of Content must have an extensive network and be confident and
committed to the ethos of TED, with a vision of bringing the world's greatest
thinkers and doers (from both within and without the University) to the 2019
events. Other responsibilities include leading speaker preparation and speaker
hospitality, working closely with all speakers throughout content development
to make sure all arrangements are met and content is rehearsed to ensure
speakers give the best talk of their life.

The Content Team is responsible for suggesting and contacting potential
speakers for the main TEDxWarwick conference and for the three TEDxWarwick
salon events, and the Director is responsible for leading this effort from
Term 3 onwards.  We are therefore looking for candidates with the following
qualities:

- Excellent research skills
- Exceptional communication and leadership skills
- Ability to remain committed and focused in the face of regular disappointment
- Capacity to rapidly synthesise information and accurately offer constructive
  feedback to further develop speakers' content
- A high level of professionalism
- An excellent comprehension of the English language

<section id="team-marketing">

The Marketing team works towards moulding the public perception and the
branding of TEDxWarwick, in and around the Warwick community, through the
promotion of our event as well as the TED ethos. The team's responsibilities
include executing a high quality on-campus and social media advertising
strategy, creating content for the blog and newsletter and running outreach
programmes that further TEDxWarwick's presence in the local community. The
Director of Marketing must therefore be able to lead the team's marketing
efforts and liaise between the Marketing Team and other TEDxWarwick teams (in
particular Creative).

We are therefore looking for applicants who:

- Can effectively communicate ideas, both verbally and in written form
- Have creative ability and original ideas
- Understand the broad audience of TEDxWarwick
- Have previous experience running a marketing campaign
- Have experience managing social media channels
- Are able to manage and execute large marketing strategies
</section>

<section id="team-corporate-relations">

The Corporate Relations Team focuses on creating and maintaining strong
partnership relations with sponsors and with the press. This is an ongoing
process throughout the year and requires a Director who is committed to working
intimately with our sponsors, both inside and outside the University, from term
3\. We are therefore looking for applicants who:

- Are professional, persuasive and confident in their interactions with the
  companies that we deal with; previous sponsorship experience is welcomed but
  not a prerequisite
- Have strong written and verbal communication skills and attention to detail
  when interacting with external firms
- Have a holistic understanding and interest in what drives TEDxWarwick and
  what makes it valuable to sponsors and the press
</section>

<section id="team-creative">

aspects of the event, ensuring that all work is of high quality and consistent
style. The Creative team's responsibilities include design of posters and
marketing material, speaker and sponsorship packs, the TEDxWarwick 2019
Magazine, stage and foyer design, creating photo and video content and
coordinating the design of the website with the Technical Director. A
successful applicant must:

  towards creating visual elements for the TEDxWarwick brand
- Have an eye for detail, with the ability to curate visual elements as a means
  to promote our events

  Team and with other TEDxWarwick teams
</section>

<section id="team-technical">
#### Technical Director

website, as well as coordinating the technical aspects of TEDxWarwick events.
The Technical Director works closely with the Creative, Marketing and
Operations teams, and in particular liaises with departments of the University
of Warwick and the Warwick Arts Centre in the build up to our main event.

We are looking for someone who:

- Has a working knowledge of videography including use of cine cameras, lens
  selection and lighting
- Has experience in website design, with knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript
  and GitHub
- Is willing to devote a significant amount of time to prepare for each event,
   and to maintain/update our website in between.
</section>

<section id="team-publications">
#### Director of Publications
Since we introduced the inaugural TEDxWarwick Magazine in 2014, we are looking
for a Director of Publications, responsible for editing and curating the
content of our 2019 magazine. The magazine is comprised of information about
the team and event, articles from previous speakers, articles on the year's

  the written word
- Have good communication skills for liaising with the Technical Director, and

Treasurer is responsible for ensuring the smooth running of the administrative
side of the event organising process. Duties include managing the budget,

We are therefore looking for an applicant who:
