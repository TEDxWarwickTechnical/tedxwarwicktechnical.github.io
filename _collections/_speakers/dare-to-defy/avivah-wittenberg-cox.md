Avivah Wittenberg-Cox is an author and authority on leadership, gender and business. She is also CEO of a leading gender consultancy, 20-first, that works with progressive global companies to gender-balance their workforce. Having witnessed significant advances toward gender equality, she is keen to help others fulfil their relationship potential and defy the traditional notion of choosing one partner for life. Her latest book *Late Love* explores the notion that everyone may have three mates during their life; their first love, their spouse and co-parent to their children and finally their soulmate. Building on that idea, Avivah focuses on the third phase of love---a deep, wise and nourishing relationship---and encourages women to reevaluate and redesign their relationships.

Having experienced the three stages of love with three different people, Avivah will explore the alternative to the "'til death do us part". Life is long and we grow and change throughout -- so why should our relationships stay the same?
